STEP 4 OF CLEANUP: EXPAND BLUEPRINT SYSTEM WITH ADDITIONAL ROUTE MODULES
========================================================================

DATE: June 24, 2025
TASK: Create additional Blueprint modules for remaining major route sections

USER REQUIREMENT:
- Continue Blueprint migration from monolithic routes.py (21,000+ lines remaining)
- Create additional Blueprint modules for major functional areas:
  * admin_routes.py → admin dashboard, user management, organization management
  * asset_routes.py → asset management, inventory tracking, asset categories
  * form_routes.py → form management, submissions, form templates
  * room_routes.py → room management, handovers, inspections
- Move route functions from routes.py into organized Blueprint files
- Update template paths to use organized structure where applicable
- Register new Blueprints in app/routes/__init__.py
- Test critical functionality after migration
- Preserve all existing functionality during migration

INITIAL STATE:
- routes.py contains ~21,000 lines of unmigrated routes
- Only 4 Blueprint modules exist (dashboard, qr, purchase, other)
- Major functional areas still in monolithic file:
  * Admin management routes
  * Asset management routes
  * Form management routes
  * Room management routes
  * Staff attendance routes
  * Compliance/offense routes
  * Meter reading routes
  * Reporting routes

BLUEPRINT REGISTRATION EXPANSION:
```python
def register_routes(app):
    from .dashboard_routes import dashboard_bp
    from .qr_routes import qr_bp
    from .purchase_routes import purchase_bp
    from .other_routes import other_bp
    from .admin_routes import admin_bp
    from .asset_routes import asset_bp
    from .form_routes import form_bp
    from .room_routes import room_bp
    
    app.register_blueprint(dashboard_bp)
    app.register_blueprint(qr_bp)
    app.register_blueprint(purchase_bp)
    app.register_blueprint(other_bp)
    app.register_blueprint(admin_bp)
    app.register_blueprint(asset_bp)

TEMPLATE PATH INTEGRATION:
- Admin routes will use templates/admin/ structure
- Asset routes will use templates/assets/ structure
- Form routes will use templates/forms/ structure
- Room routes will use templates/rooms/ structure

MIGRATION STRATEGY:
- Phase 1: Create admin_routes.py with core admin functionality
- Phase 2: Create asset_routes.py with asset management
- Phase 3: Create form_routes.py with form handling
- Phase 4: Create room_routes.py with room management
- Test each Blueprint module after creation
- Verify all routes continue working
- Update template paths where needed
