✓ Documentation standards followed

FUTURE EXPANSION CAPABILITIES:
1. Additional specialized Blueprint modules can be easily added
2. API Blueprint modules for external integrations
3. Blueprint-specific middleware and error handlers
4. Route-level caching and optimization
5. Individual module testing frameworks
6. Blueprint-specific configuration management

STEP 4 BLUEPRINT EXPANSION: 100% COMPLETE
